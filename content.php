<h3 style="padding-left: 30px;color: green;">The best way to do it would be to sign up for emailers, price alerts, newsletters that various aggregator sites and even the hotel websites offer. This is a perfect way to keep tab of the upcoming discounts, flash sales, or some interesting promotional offer that they are coming up with. This can help you land a better price for the hotel of your choice. However, if you do not wish to rely on these tools, make sure you close the booking at least a couple of months ahead of the date of your journey for a better tariff. Also, be aware of the fact that holiday season spikes up the hotel prices, so you should always make your booking at least a few weeks ahead if you are planning to travel in the high season.</h3>
